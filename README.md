## Description:
An API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. Using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, additionally uses a JavaScript date library to format timestamps.

## Acceptance Criteria:

- When you enter the command to invoke the application then the server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.  
- Testing API GET routes in Insomnia Core for users and thoughts return the data for each of these routes in a formatted JSON
- Testing API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core are able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts

- Testing API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core are able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list.
